A subset of data from the World Health Organization Global Tuberculosis
Report, and accompanying global populations.
}
\details{
The data uses the original codes given by the World Health
Organization. The column names for columns five through 60 are made by
combining \code{new_} to a code for method of diagnosis (\code{rel} =
relapse, \code{sn} = negative pulmonary smear, \code{sp} = positive
pulmonary smear, \code{ep} = extrapulmonary) to a code for gender
(\code{f} = female, \code{m} = male) to a code for age group (\code{014} =
0-14 yrs of age, \code{1524} = 15-24 years of age, \code{2534} = 25 to
34 years of age, \code{3544} = 35 to 44 years of age, \code{4554} = 45 to
54 years of age, \code{5564} = 55 to 64 years of age, \code{65} = 65 years
of age or older).
